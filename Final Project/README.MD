## Overview

### Description

Do you love me provides personalized reminders, notifications, and love letters to be accessed from a users phone. The notifications are customizable but come baseline as "You should send her a message" or "buy her a small gift of something that reminded you of her" and things of similar nature. Allows love letters to be written that will be displayed through the app and provides a button to be pressed that will (If i'm capable of it) notify the spouses app that the user "wants attention"; if not it'll display a card that was created instead. cards are not like love letters, cards are specifically shown for the trigger event, so it should be personalized towards the moment. 

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Relationships
- **Mobile:** Notifications, haptic feedback, camera, ease of access
- **Story:** Helps an individual to remember certain things or perform actions, and act coy with their signficiant other
- **Market:** Anybody in a relationship, although the target audience would be towards ADHD or stoic individuals who lack emotional signaling and have bad timing.
- **Habit:** Users would hopefully set the app up for their needs and then act on the notifications, only Occasionally accessing the app to view notes written for them or to hit the button
- **Scope:** Most features are incredibly simple, with minimal features the app would still be usable, and the desired results are well documented: help aid relationships via personallized reminders. The hardest features would be implementing interactability between any users.
